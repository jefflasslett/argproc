# argproc

This is a small Haskell program that shows one way to process command-line
arguments. I was guided by the information and code at 
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/High-level_option_handling_with_GetOpt>

This program is probably only helpful for haskell noobs like myself.

## Compiling

```
$ runhaskell Setup.hs configure
$ runhaskell Setup.hs build
```
